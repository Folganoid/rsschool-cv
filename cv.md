## About myself
&nbsp; &nbsp; From 2016, as a freelancer, I was engaged in the development of sites, web applications, REST-API, layout, support and administration.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; From January 2018 to July 2022 held the positions of a full-stack and a backend developer at E-Delux GmbH with the main focus: online trading. In particular, the development of functionality for supporting, processing, automating trade and logistics processes. Ensuring the interaction of ERP- and CMS-systems with  the most popular marketplaces in Europe. Working with clients, collection, processing and data synchronization, statistics, reporting, etc.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the EPAM course, I want to remember and pull up the front-end and become competitive for the full stack position.
